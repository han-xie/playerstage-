Building
--------

The opaque can be built by making a directory (anywhere on your system where
you have write permissions will do), changing to that directory and executing
CMake with the opaque's source directory as an argument. For opaque, if you
have installed Player into /usr/local, you could do the following:

$ cd ~
$ mkdir multidriver
$ cd multidriver
$ ccmake /usr/local/share/player/opaques/plugins/multidriver/

Use the configure option (press 'c' in the Linux ncurses-based UI, for opaque)
until the generate option becomes available, then use that (press 'g' in the
ncurses UI). Then use the standard method of compiling for your environment to
compile (on Linux, this will probably be GNU Makefiles, so type 'make').

Running
-------

The opaque creates a shared library (libmultidriver.so on Unix-based
systems), which is loaded by the server using the opaque.cfg configuration
file. Copy this to the directory where you built the opaque and execute the
Player server:

$ player opaque.cfg
